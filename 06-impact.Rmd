# Impact & FAIR {#fair}

In 2016, the **[FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)** were published in _Scientific Data_. The authors intended to provide guidelines to improve the **F**indability, **A**ccessibility, **I**nteroperability, and **R**euse of digital assets. The principles emphasize machine-actionability (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data because of the increase in volume, complexity, and creation speed of data.

A practical “how to” guidance to go FAIR can be found in the **[Three-point FAIRification Framework](https://www.go-fair.org/how-to-go-fair/)**.
